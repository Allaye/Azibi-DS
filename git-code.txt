git init

git add -A

git commit -m 'Added my project'

git remote add origin git@github.com:scotch-io/my-new-project.git(diffent from b4)

git push -u -f origin master

The -u flag sets the remote origin as the default. This lets you later easily just do git push and git pull without having to specifying an origin since we always want GitHub in this case.


Use git remote -v to show your current remotes. You should see the URL of your

git pull upstream master to "pull" any changes from the "master" branch of the "upstream" into your local repository.

git push origin BRANCH_NAME. This "pushes" your changes to the "BRANCH_NAME" branch of the "origin" (which is your fork on GitHub).

Changing a Git Remote’s URL 
git remote -v

Use the git remote set-url command followed by the remote name , and the remote’s URL(new):

git remote set-url origin git@gitserver.com:user/repo_name.git
